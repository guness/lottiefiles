# LottieFiles
LottieFiles is a marketplace application where you can find animations.
=================

Some Key Features
---------------
- UI is implemented in declarative way using Jetpack Compose
- Dark Theme is supported. App randomly launches in dark mode for the sake of simplicity for now
- Design system is implemented for Buttons, Texts, Colors, Sizes
- Following structures are used for clean code: Entity/DTO, UseCase, Repository, Webservice, Database, ViewModel
- Data is transferred to UI using ViewModels
- Robolectric and Espresso is used for testing ViewModels in JVM environment for Unit testing
- Data from API is cached using Room
- Hilt is used for Dependency Injection
- Jetpack Compose Navigation is used for routing

Missing Pieces
---------------
- QR Code scan is not implemented as it will not provide a better understanding of code quality now.
- Error Handling is not implemented for Webservice. App will not crash but API will fail silently.
- Progress during API calls is not implemented.
- No authentication is required in order to login.
- CI/CD pipeline, Crashlytics, and other essential part of production system is missing.

Getting Started
---------------
This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
`gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

There are two Gradle tasks for testing the project:
`test` - for running unit tests
